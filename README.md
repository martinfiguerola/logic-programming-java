# Logic Programming Training – Java

This repository contains my training in programming logic using Java,
focused on technical interviews (Junior → Semi-Senior).

## Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Learn to think before coding
- Practice interview-style exercises

## Structure
- Phase 0: Fundamentals (logic without code)
- Phase 1: Basic logic (arrays, loops, conditions)
- Phase 2: Structured thinking (patterns)
- Phase 3: Interview mindset
